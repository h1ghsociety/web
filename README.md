# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Features

### Registering Cycles and Plants

With this app, you can easily register your current cycle along with its plants. This allows you to keep track of your garden's progress and monitor the growth of your plants.

### Adding Plants to the Cycle

You can add new plants to your cycle at any time. This feature enables you to expand your garden and diversify the types of plants you are growing.

### Filtering Plants by Strain

The app provides a feature to filter plants by strain. This allows you to easily find and manage plants of specific strains, making it convenient to track and organize your garden.

### Most Cultivated Strains

You can view a list of the most cultivated strains in the app. This feature provides insights into popular strains among users, helping you discover new strains and trends in gardening.

### Timeline Gallery on Plant Details Page

Each plant has a timeline gallery on its details page. This feature allows you to view a chronological collection of photos documenting the plant's growth over time. By exploring the timeline gallery, you can visually track the progress of each plant and observe its development stages.

### Posting Photos to Track Progress

The app also allows you to post photos to register the progress of your garden. By regularly documenting your garden's development, you can visually track the growth of your plants and share your gardening journey with others.
